# Arduino firmware for Universal-ALICE
With the goal of "Instrumentation for Every Student" in mind this project is intended to lower all barriers to providing a hardware and software platform for teaching electronic circuits to engineering students. Every student should have access to affordable hardware and software to measure their experiments.
This project offers a free open source software user interface that is compatible with hardware produced in large quantities at low cost (ranging from $5 to $20) from multiple suppliers.
